            <h2>Recognizing Depression</h2>
            <p>Feeling down from time to time is a normal part of life, but if you're feeling persistently sad or
                hopeless, it might be something more. Depression can sneak up on you with a variety of signs. You might
                notice emotional changes like a constant feeling of sadness or loss of interest in things you used to
                enjoy. Physically, you might feel unusually tired or struggle with sleep. It's important to know that
                you're not alone, and recognizing these signs is the first step toward getting the support you need.
                There are different treatment options available, from talking to a therapist to lifestyle changes that
                can make a big difference. Remember, reaching out for help is a sign of strength.</p>

            <h2>Managing Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Anxiety can feel overwhelming, like a constant state of worry or fear that doesn't seem to go away. It's
                not just in your head—it can affect your body too, causing symptoms like a racing heart or sweating.
                Understanding the different types of anxiety, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Panic Disorder,
                can help you recognize what you might be experiencing. There are effective ways to manage anxiety,
                including therapy, medication, and techniques like mindfulness. Finding what works best for you can take
                some time, but it's worth it. Taking small steps to manage your anxiety can lead to big improvements in
                your daily life.</p>

            <h2>Stress Relief Tips</h2>
            <p>Stress is something we all experience, but it can become overwhelming if it's not managed well. It can
                come from many sources, like work pressures or personal relationships. Finding ways to relieve stress is
                crucial for your mental and physical health. Simple techniques like deep breathing exercises or taking
                regular breaks can provide immediate relief. In the long term, developing good habits like regular
                exercise and healthy eating can help keep stress at bay. Creating a personal stress-relief plan that
                fits into your life can be incredibly beneficial. It's about finding what works for you and making it a
                part of your routine.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Understanding Self-Care</h2>
            <p>CSelf-care is more than just pampering yourself; it's about taking active steps to care for your mental,
                emotional, and physical health. This can include anything from exercising regularly to taking time out
                to relax and do things you enjoy. It's important to identify what you need and set aside time for those
                activities. Making self-care a part of your daily routine can help you feel more balanced and resilient.
                It's not selfish—it's essential for your well-being. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup. Taking
                care of yourself enables you to be there for others as well.</p>

            <h2>Spotting Burnout</h2>
            <p>Burnout can happen when you're overwhelmed and overworked for too long. It can show up as feeling
                constantly tired, losing interest in your work or daily activities, and even physical symptoms like
                headaches. Recognizing the signs of burnout early is important. It's crucial to set boundaries, take
                regular breaks, and make time for relaxation. If you're already feeling burnt out, it's okay to take a
                step back and seek support. Talking to a professional can help you find strategies to recover and
                prevent future burnout. Remember, taking care of yourself is not just an option—it's a necessity.</p>
